  <h1>my education history</h1>
  <ul>
  <li> I finished highschool in 2019 from college saint Andre in <strong>mpc(Mathematics,Physics and computer science) </strong>and i was very interested in computer science and still now am still interested thats why i started applying in<strong> Moringa school</strong> so that i can improve my level in coding and now i can say that i've improved even though its not as much as i wish to be but i hope that i will be the best software developer and i believe that nothing is imposible. </li>
<li>The time when i was in primary i was much interested in piloting but the time i started searching and asking many people about things in now days world and i saw that technology is the best things that is needed most, thats why i changed my interest in piloting and i decided to continue with computer in secondary and now i take it as my career which will help me in my country development in technology.</li>
